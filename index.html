<p>Many years ago, a visionary named Hershey predicted that the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">digital native</a>" generation would soon face <a href="https://xkcd.com/1963/">a challenge unlike any other</a> in the history of humanity. To prepare for this inevitability, she staked her claim to one of the most glorious email usernames ever imagined and carved out her very own slice of the internet age.</p>

<p>Hershey neglected to purchase the domain name that went with this email address. It was a small risk, but who in their right mind would purchase a domain without the corresponding email? Unfortunately, this nightmare of a scenario eventually came to pass when a few opportunists saw a chance to appropriate Hershey's legacy and make it their own.</p>

<p>Now, on the anniversary of Hershey's birthday, those opportunists are offering a chance for you to be a part of this legacy as well. The ownership of this domain will expire soon, but it is too valuable to simply be discarded or auctioned off to the highest bidder. Instead, we have created a series of puzzles for those that aspire to Hershey's legacy to prove their worth.</p>

<p>If you  are up to the challenge--please begin <a href="/happy-birthday.jpg">here</a>!.</p>
